# Solutions for Tuenti Challenge 8 (2018) by Alejandro Pinel Mart√≠nez

These are my solutions to some of the challenges for the Tuenti Challenge of 2018.

I did this challenge when I was starting to code, so it may have some beginner bad programming practices. Even so, I managed to reach position 74. 
I solved the problems number 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9, but later I solved number 10 too. Everyone is written in c++.
